# Algorithms
There you can find some algorithms that developed by me when I was reading the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. Inside it you can see some different with book as source, but I think that I adapt them well.

### Search
Inside **search.py** you can find the following algorithms that can find item (in list of 10_000_000 elements) by time after dash:
* Stupid (simple) search  - 0.90677571s
* Binary search - 0.00001287s
* Python search - 0.25032830s

Obviosly, **binary search** is better of algorithms above. But you can execute that youself and check speed and iterations count with your computer and numbers just for fun =)

### Sort
As well inside **sort.py** are following algorithms of sorting list of 5_000 elements (also each one provided with execution time):
* Choice sort - 0.46786356s
* Quick sort - 0.01690745s
* Python sort - 0.00043821s

### Graph
In file **graph.py** I provided search algorithms to work with graphs. See below.
* Breadth First Search (+ function that is trying to find shortest path without weights)
* Djikstra Algorithm
